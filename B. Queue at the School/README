" Problem: Queue at the School

" Constraints:
" Time limit per test: 2 seconds
" Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

" Description:
" During the break, schoolchildren (boys and girls) form a queue of n people in the canteen. 
" Initially, the children are ordered based on when they entered the canteen. 
" However, boys feel awkward standing in front of girls and start letting the girls move 
" forward, causing the queue to rearrange each second.

" Process:
" - Each second, if a boy ('B') stands directly in front of a girl ('G') in the queue, 
"   they swap places.
" - This process repeats for t seconds, or until no more swaps are possible.

" Input:
" 1. The first line contains two integers, n and t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 50), where:
"    - n is the number of children in the queue.
"    - t is the time (in seconds) after which the queue stops rearranging.
" 2. The second line contains a string s of length n, which represents the initial arrangement 
"    of the children in the queue:
"    - 'B': Boy.
"    - 'G': Girl.

" Output:
" - A single string a describing the arrangement of the queue after t seconds.

" Examples:

" Example 1:
" Input:
" 5 1
" BGGBG
" Output:
" GBGGB

" Example 2:
" Input:
" 5 2
" BGGBG
" Output:
" GGBGB

" Example 3:
" Input:
" 4 1
" GGGB
" Output:
" GGGB

" Notes:
" - Boys ('B') and girls ('G') swap positions only if a boy is directly in front of a girl.
" - The process continues for t seconds or until no swaps are possible during a given second.

Approach
One outer loop to loop time and one inner loop to go through the queue and swap boys and girls
