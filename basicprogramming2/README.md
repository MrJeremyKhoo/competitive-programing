chose to sort the list because noticed that problems easier solved with sorting
# Case 1
no need look for duplicates since sum is odd number in is integers. solution involves and depends on mergesort O(nlogn). Faster solution involves looking for compliment(7777-1) in a set of numbers in arrayO(n). O(n^2) solution to "find exsistance of pair that sum to ..." is not accepted
# Case 2
since sorted just look at elements next to each other. O(n)
# Case 3
since sorted just count until the element changes, if > n/2 then output that number O(n)
# Case 4
this case must use sorting and is trivial after sorted. dependent on sorting O(nlogn)
# Case 5
since sorted just look for first number above 100 and last number below 999 then output the center numbers. O(n)
