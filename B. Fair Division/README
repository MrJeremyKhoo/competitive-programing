o##r Division

" Constraints:
" Time limit per test: 2 seconds
" Memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

" Description:
" Alice and Bob received n candies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram 
" or 2 grams. They want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total 
" weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.
"
" Check if they can do that. 
" Note that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.

" Input:
" 1. The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.
" 2. For each test case:
"    - The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of candies Alice 
"      and Bob received.
"    - The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an — the weights of the candies 
"      (either 1 or 2 grams).
"
" It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

" Output:
" For each test case, output "YES" if all candies can be divided into two sets with the 
" same total weight, otherwise output "NO".
" The output can be in any case (e.g., "YES", "yes", "Yes").

" Examples:

" Example 1:
" Input:
" 5
" 2
" 1 1
" 2
" 1 2
" 4
" 1 2 1 2
" 3
" 2 2 2
" 3
" 2 1 2
" Output:
" YES
" NO
" YES
" NO
" NO

" Notes:
" - In the first test case, Alice and Bob can each take one candy, so both will have a 
"   total weight of 1.
" - In the second test case, any division will be unfair.
" - In the third test case, both Alice and Bob can take two candies, one of weight 1 and 
"   one of weight 2.
" - In the fourth test case, it is impossible to divide three identical candies between 
"   two people.
" - In the fifth test case, any division will also be unfair.

Approach:
Identify yes case or no case

In no case:
Only when there are odd number of 2s and odd number of 1s then we cannot divide.

In yes case:
x = no. 1s
y = no. 2s


that means 

x % 2 = 0
and 
y % 2 = 0

or 

x % 2 = 1
and 
y % 2 = 0
y > 0
