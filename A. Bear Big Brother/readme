Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?

Input
The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 less than or equals to a less than or equals to b less than or equals to 10) â€” the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.

Output
Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


Limak - a
Bob - b

they both grow at different rates

2 solutions:
brute force. do a while loop and loop until Limak weight exceed Bob.
O(n)

Find intesection of the growth graph:
Limak = 3*(years)*(initial weight) 
Bob = 2*(years)*(initial weight) 

Solve for years when Limak >= Bob:

Limak >= Bob

3^(years)*a >= 2^(years)*b

years > ln(b/a) / ln(3/2)

*Note
But looking for more than not equals to:
Check if years is whole numeber. add 1 if it is whole number because folloing year, Limak will weigh more

O(1)
